## Setup


### Load Packages

```{r load-packages}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(statsr)
library(gmodels)
```

### Load Data


```{r dataimport}
library(haven)
preprocessed2018 <- read_dta("D:/CFPS Research-20191101T212903Z-001/dispatchedworkersCFPS/data/preprocessed2018.dta")
```


### Continuous Variables


Check if the continuous variable is different across DE and RE significantly with `ANOVA`


Test the strength of such association with `intra-class correlation`.


Hypothesis: The means of continuous variable for DE and RE are the same. 

```{r ageANOVA}
age.aov <- aov(age ~ dispatch_Dispatch, data = preprocessed2018)
summary(age.aov)
```
